## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

Helps victims of trauma get valid psychiatric advice to deal with "triggers" that if left unchecked can derail progress made by a patient or at least cause emotional agony for those trying to recover. Trauma accounts for an estimated 79,000 deaths each year, compared to 49,000 non-communicable disease deaths and 15,000 infectious disease deaths (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5269564/)
